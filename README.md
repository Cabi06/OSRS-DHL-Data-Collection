DHL Data Collection

An attempt at creating an automated pipeline to gather data from an API and merge them into an automatically updating table which
ideally I would then use on a wesbite afterwards. This would act as both a widget, but also passively gather data for longer 
periods than the 3 month history available from the data source automatically. This data is then used for a separate LSTM project,
in which I would later like to implement a variety of data variables for analysis/predictions.
